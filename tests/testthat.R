# Turning off testing when the mock library is being used (e.g. on travis)
# as indicated by the environmental variable KNITRO_MOCK. 
#
# This is of course a bad idea: It would be better to have the mock library
# return real (fake) results instead of garbage so that I can actually
# use it for testing the package. The sole benefit of turning the tests off
# is to get the "build passing" button from travis.
